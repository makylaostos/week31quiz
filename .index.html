    <h2>My favorite part of Advanced Web</h2>
    <p>My favorite part of being in advanced web is getting code even though it i can be difficult. It was also fun being able to work on my website for my business.  It was cool</p>
    <h2>My Least Favorite Part of Advanced Web</h2>
    <p>My least favorite thing about Patino is that there is no library.  Sometimes I dont want to talk to people but I feel like I'm forced to socialize with people since there is no library.  It sucks sometimes</p>
